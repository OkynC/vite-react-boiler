# React + TypeScript + Vite + ReactQuery + React-Router-DOM

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite.

## Prerequisites
This is a React project, please make sure you have the following installed:
- Node (v22+). To handle Node version, we recommend to use NVM.
- NPM or Yarn (or another package manager). For this boiler-plate, we used NPM

## Installation
- Fork the repository to use it as a template
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Developing with the project
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
- Several commands are available to handle the project:
  - `npm run lint`: Lint the project
  - `npm run format`: Format the project
  - `npm run check:types`: Validate all typing
  - `npm run test`: Run the tests

## Info and examples
To help you start from somewhere, I included the following examples:
- react-query: Fetch data from an API (the author API is an example)
- react-router-dom: Navigate between pages (only one page for now)
- zod: Validate data from the API (and anable typing for Props)
